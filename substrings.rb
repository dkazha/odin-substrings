def substrings(str, dictionary)
  # Turn the string into an array using the appropriate method
  # Iterate over the array and check to see if every word in the dictionary is in every word of the array
  # Use the reduce method and add a new hash as the initial value for the accumulator
  # If it is in the dictionary - add it to the hash and add 1 to a counter
  # Return the hash
